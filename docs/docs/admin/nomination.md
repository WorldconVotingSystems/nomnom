# The Nomination Process

The nominations for the Hugo Awards take place according to the current year's applicable [WSFS Constitution](https://www.wsfs.org/rules-of-the-world-science-fiction-society/). As of this writing, those are the 2024-2025 rules, which for the purposes of NomNom are unchanged from the 2023 ruleset.

Specific sections of note are:

* 3.2 - indicates the rules for what a committee can do to modify a work's category, and many other eligibility rules. NomNom is not concerned with eligibility but does provide tools for the admin to record their rulings.
* 3.3 - defines the categories. NomNom does not attempt to match these, and instead defers to the administrator to provide them as data for the Election
* 3.7.1 - NomNom restricts members to 5 nominations
* 3.9 - This section defines EPH

NomNom is able to perform EPH in full, and has a view to display the entire sequence of eliminations for each category. This is not intended for direct publication to the membership, but is instead a tool for the administrator to use to formulate a report in their chosen format.
