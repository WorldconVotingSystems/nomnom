# Paper Ballots

To handle paper ballots, the Admin can create a member record, and then manually enter their nominations.

## Creating a Member Record

This is accomplished in the Admin dashboard, for example /admin/nominate/nominatingmemberprofile/

1. Click "Add Nominating Member Profile"
2. Fill in the member number from the convention, and the name of the member.
3. Click "Save"

## Editing the Ballot

To edit the ballot, select the member profile from the list (either by searching, listing, or in the case of one you've just created, you'll already be on that page).

The "Ballot Management" section will have links to all open elections. You can choose "Manage Nominations" or "Manage Votes" from that set.

You will be taken to the final ballot page, but in the role of the member
instead of yourself. You can edit the entire ballot in place, and when you are
done and save, the member's ballot will be updated.

!!! info

    If the member has an email address registered in NomNom, it will be
    emailed the results the ballot being saved, along with a message indicating
    that the change was made.
