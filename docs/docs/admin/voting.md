# Voting on the Hugo Awards

Voting for the Hugo Awards takes place according to the current year's applicable [WSFS Constitution](https://www.wsfs.org/rules-of-the-world-science-fiction-society/). As of this writing, those are the 2024-2025 rules, which for the purposes of NomNom are unchanged from the 2023 ruleset.

Specific sections of note are:

* 3.11.3 - requires all ballots to include "No Award" as an option
* 3.12 - defines "No Award"'s role as a runoff candidate
* 6.4 - defines the vote tallying process

NomNom is able to tally the Hugo ballots and provide a detailed report to the administrator, as well as showing a complete finalist and elimination process. That view is restricted to users with permissions to do so, rather than being public; it should be formatted for publication by the administrator.
