This directory can override any templates in `nominate/templates/bits/`

It's intended for conventions to offer custom templates that depend on the context NomNom provides. For details on how it is used, see the Glasgow 2024 site at https://github.com/WorldconVotingSystems/glasgow2024/tree/main/glasgow_2024_app/templates
