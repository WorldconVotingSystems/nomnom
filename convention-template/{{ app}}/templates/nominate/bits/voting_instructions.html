    Note that this form does not autosave. You will need to
    click the save buttons at the bottom of each section. The
    button will turn from light to dark blue, and the text will
    change from black to white, and remain that way until you
    click somewhere else on the page, indicating that your vote
    has been recorded. A copy of your ballot will be emailed to
    you after no activity on your ballot in 10 .
