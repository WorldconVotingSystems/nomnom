  Your convention site {{ convention_name }} is now set up.

  It's almost ready to go, but there are some steps you'll need to do the first
  time to set up your environment.

  0. Ensure you have `just` installed:

      brew install just

  1. The .env file isn't set up with your local ports and credentials. Run this:

      just resetdb  # note -- this will DELETE ALL YOUR DEVELOPMENT DATA, skip it if you're not sure.
      just bootstrap

  2. Once this is done, you can run the website using `just serve` and the email workers using `just worker`
