<h1>Nominating Ballot for the 2024 Hugo Awards, Lodestar Award for Best Young Adult Book, and Astounding Award for Best New Writer
  
Deadline</h1>
<p>All ballots must be received by Saturday, 9 March 2024, 16:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) (UTC+0)</p>

<h1>How to Nominate</h1>
<p>Enter your nominations in the text fields of the appropriate categories below. This form does not autosave. You will need to click the 'Save this Category' buttons at the bottom of each category, or 'Save All' at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>When you save your ballot below, you are signing your ballot as {{ request.user.convention_profile.preferred_name }}.</p>

<p>You may nominate up to five persons or works in each category. However, if you are not familiar with the works that fall into that category, you are permitted (and encouraged) to make fewer nominations or none at all. Your nominations are equally weighted – the order in which you list them has no effect on the outcome.</p>

<p>“No Award” will appear automatically in every single category on the final ballot – there is no need to include that choice on the nomination form.</p>

<p>You may return to this form and make as many changes as you would like to your nomination ballot up until the deadline of Saturday, 9 March 2024, 16:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) (UTC+0).</p>
