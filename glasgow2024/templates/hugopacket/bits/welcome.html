<p>Welcome to the 2024 Hugo Voter Packet!</p>
<p>The contents of the Packet are made available to the voters through the kindness of the creators and their publishers. We urge all of our members to be grateful for the material provided and understanding of any finalist who has chosen not to participate.</p>
<p>The material in the Packet is provided only for the use of members of Glasgow 2024. Please don’t distribute Packet materials to others.</p>
<p>You can download Packet materials in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Download the materials for a specific Hugo Award category by clicking the category name in the following list.</li>
  <li>Download the entire Packet at once by clicking the <b>Full Packet</b> link.</li>
  <li>Download the entire Packet except for the Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form category by clicking the <b>Full Packet without DPLF</b> link. (The materials for that category include two full movies, so we’re providing an option to easily download the rest of the Packet.)</li>
</ul>
<p>We received no materials for the Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form category, so there’s no download link for that category.</p>
<p>Each category’s download include a contents PDF with more information about the provided materials in that category.</p>
