<p>Welcome to the 2024 Hugo Voter Packet!</p>
<p>The material in the Packet is provided only for the use of members of Glasgow 2024. <strong>Please don’t distribute Packet materials to others.</strong></p>
<p>You can download Packet materials in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Download the entire Packet at once, except for the Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form category. (That category is a large download because it includes two full movies.)</li>
  <li>Download the materials for a specific Hugo Award category.</li>
</ul>
<p>We received no materials for the Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form category, so there’s no download link for that category.</p>
<p>The download for each category includes a contents PDF with more information about the materials in that category. Almost every category includes material from all the finalists in the category, except for the following: Best Related Work (5 finalists included); Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form (3 finalists); and Best Game (5 finalists).</p>
<p>If you have questions about the Packet or need assistance, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hugo-help@glasgow2024.org">hugo-help@glasgow2024.org</a>.</p>
